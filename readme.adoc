= GORM standalone demos


Demonstrates how gorm can be used in a simple gradle based project. Domain classes are stored in package +entity+ .

Have a look at the tests to see how it is used.

== Notes

gorm calls should be made inside a transaction. Otherwise entities are detached immediately. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
Person2.withTransaction {
  Person2 p = Person2.findByName(personName)
  def address2 = p.address2
  result = address2.street
}
----
